# Server-Client Project

This project implements a simple client-server architecture using UDP for file transfer. The client can request file listings and download files in chunks from the server.

## Project Structure

```
server-client-project
├── client
│   └── Client.py       # Client-side code for communicating with the server
├── server
│   └── Server.py       # Server-side code for handling requests and serving files
└── README.md           # Documentation for the project
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd server-client-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed. You may need to install additional libraries depending on your environment.

3. **Run the server:**
   Navigate to the `server` directory and run:
   ```
   python Server.py
   ```

4. **Run the client:**
   Open another terminal, navigate to the `client` directory, and run:
   ```
   python Client.py
   ```

## Usage

- The client will prompt for the server IP address. Enter the appropriate address to connect.
- The client will periodically request the file list from the server and allow you to download files.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries are required for basic functionality, but ensure your environment supports UDP communication.

## Notes

- Ensure that the server is running before starting the client.
- The project is designed for educational purposes and may require enhancements for production use.
